# LangGraph Chatbot Agent

## Project Overview

This project implements a chatbot agent powered by LangGraph, designed for complex conversational flows. It utilizes the Gemini Pro model from Google's Generative AI API to provide informative responses based on the provided context. The system first retrieves relevant data, generates an initial response, and if needed, refines the response for more complete answers.

## Key Features

-   **Context-Aware Chatbot:** Uses retrieved context to provide relevant and accurate answers.
-   **Refinement Mechanism:** Refines initial responses to ensure they are comprehensive.
-   **LangGraph Workflow:** Implements a structured conversational flow using LangGraph.
-   **Google Generative AI:** Leverages Gemini Pro for language processing and understanding.
-   **FastAPI Integration:** Built as a REST API using FastAPI for easy deployment and usage.
